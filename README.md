Steps involved for  data analysis and visualization 
-------------------------------------------------------


### **Data Acquisition and Preparation**

**Data Source:** Kaggle dataset 
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or deletion)
- Address outliers (e.g., removal or capping)
- Convert data types as needed (e.g., strings to numerical values)
- Standardize data formats (e.g., date and time)

**Data Exploration:**
- Summary statistics
- Data visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
- Correlation analysis

### **Data Analysis**

**Key Metrics:**
- Total sales
- Average order value
- Customer lifetime value
- Sales by region
- Sales by restaurant type
- Sales trends over time



**Segmentation and Targeting:**
- Analyze sales by customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location)
- Identify high-value customer segments

### **Visualization**

**Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, or other suitable tools
**Visualization Types:** Bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heatmaps
**Key Insights:**
- Visualize sales trends over time
- Compare sales across different regions and restaurant types
- Identify correlations between variables

### **Findings and Insights**

* **Summary of Key Findings:**

 1)  Visualization making a bar plot of number of resturant in different location

Observation:- The above visualization importance is that where we can open the restutant we can decide which places have more restaurants we should not open there

2.Comapring how many resturants have online order facility

4.Visualizing online order vs rate

Observation :- from here we can see the resturants having online orders are higher rated the maximum line for resturants with online order is 4.8 and where there is no online order there max rate is 4.1

5.Visualizing book table with rating

Observation:- from here we can draw a conclusion the resturants having book table have a higher average rating then without book table in resturant thus from here we can tell that if we are opening a resturant we can keep book a table for dining
